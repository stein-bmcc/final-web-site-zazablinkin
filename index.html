                <h2>About My MultiMedia Experience</h2>
                <p>I'm a multimedia student passionate about creativity, technology, and digital marketing. Follow along as I explore new projects,  In my multimedia class with Professor Stein, we explored various tools and techniques for creating and editing digital content. We used Audacity for audio recording and editing, learning how to cut, edit, and apply effects to improve the sound quality. I also worked with After Effects for motion graphics and animation, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for graphic design and image manipulation, allowing me to create visually engaging content. Additionally, we utilized GitHub for website coding, where I developed and hosted this website. Through GitHub, I learned about version control and how to manage my coding projects collaboratively. In this portfolio, I will guide you through the key skills I’ve gained in these areas, reflecting on how each tool contributed to my growth as a multimedia creator. By navigating this site, you’ll get a deeper understanding of my experience with these platforms, the challenges I faced, and the creative solutions I implemented.</p>

                <h2>Audacity/ What it is</h2>
                    <p>Audacity is an open-source audio production software that allows users to record, edit, and enhance audio. I use it to record sound, then edit by cutting unwanted parts and moving sections around. I apply effects like equalization, compression, reverb, and pitch adjustments to improve audio quality. Audacity also lets me layer multiple tracks, mixing vocals, music, and sound effects seamlessly. Once the editing is complete, I export the final product in various formats for sharing or uploading. It’s a versatile tool that helps bring creative audio projects to life.</p>
